Hello, my name is Adrian Sekajar Ruiz, and I am a computer
science major at Uri. I love computer science, but I also
hate it. The best part about computer science is that it
pays well, but it is also really hard. I enjoy the campus,
but at the same time I am not a fan of it. During the
winter, I just want to go home really, really bad.
