1 minute reviews. Nintendo land ready go. Much better than I
expected. It really gives you a good idea of all the
different things that the new gamepad can do. I was really
surprised by how much fun I was having with all the
different minigames based on old Nintendo franchises. Some
of them are really good, especially when played multiplayer.
Probably the best games on there are the Pikmin one, the
Metroid one, and the Donkey Kong one. The only one that
really sucks is the Octopus dancing. A lot of the games are
only okay by yourself. You get a lot more fun out of if you
play with more friends. So, you know, if you're going to be
playing your Wii U with a lot of people around, nintendo
Land is absolutely worth a purchase. To be honest, I was
having so much fun with Nintendo Land that I kept going back
to it. It has a lot of variety. It can really show you the
ropes of what the gamepad can do. And I think it's a better
packing title than Wii Sports was. For the original Wii,
Nintendo Land earns an eight out of ten.
