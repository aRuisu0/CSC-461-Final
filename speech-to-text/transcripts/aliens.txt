1 minute review. Aliens? Colonial Marines. Ready? Go. It's
bad. It's really bad. The singleplayer campaign is one of
the most disappointing things, with some of the worst enemy
AI. Terrible cutscenes and awful story with a completely
stupid, insulting ending that I have ever seen. Every alien
dies so quickly. You just plow through everything, making
you never feel threatened, never feel challenged, and then
you're not having any fun. The best feature it has is
playing as aliens in the multiplayer mode, and controlling
an alien is absolutely terrible. There's really nothing good
worth mentioning about this game, but at least it functions.
This game sucks. Aliens Colonial marines gets a two out of
ten.
