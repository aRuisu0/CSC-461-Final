1 minute review. The Oregon Trail. Ready? Go. It's just like
the Oregon Trail, but this time with zombies. And just like
the Oregon Trail, you'll need to create a party of five
people and get them to the safe haven you'll constantly need
to scavenge for supplies. You can also trade and do some
jobs at town to get more. It essentially has a bunch of
minigames to get you through the game, but none of them are
especially exciting. If anything, a lot of them are too
similar to each other, and certain ones get repeated too
often. And they aren't very difficult. The most unique thing
this game has is having one of your party members get bit by
a zombie. You can either use up more supplies to keep them
alive or end their misery. But the final mission of the game
is easier the more party members you have alive. But even
the final mission isn't all that cool or difficult. It's not
really a game that will retain your attention or make you
want to go back to it. But you may get a couple of hours of
entertainment from it. And it's only $5 on Steam. The Oregon
Trail gets six out of ten.
