1 minute review is XCOM enemy unknown. Ready? Go. Oh, my
God. I love this game. It's amazing. It is a topdown
strategy game, pure and simple. It's turn based combat with
a lot of base operations outside of that, and it's
phenomenal. It's very, very. Similar to the original. One,
but not exactly the same, which is good because they updated
it, so. It works really, really well. With what they have
nowadays. I love all the aliens to fight. I really enjoy the
tactics called combat. I love how challenging it is. The
Iron Man mode, which makes it that you can only have one
save file and you can't make your own saves. Makes it very,
very difficult and a lot of fun. Lots of replayability with
a lot of options. Different researches. Different places to
start. There are some minor. Grievances, like looks. Like
the character shoots her walls if. A camera gets weird in
combat. Or you can't select the tile that you want. What's
above another one? But these are all very minor annoyances.
I highly recommend menu. Go out and buy this. And if you're
someone who needs a score, ExCom Enemy Unknown gets a nine
out of ten.
