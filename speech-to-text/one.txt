1 minute review. Evoland ready? Go. So much wasted potential. It's an RPG that's literally half Legend of Zelda, half Final Fantasy only anytime you find a treasure chest, you upgrade the game itself, such as getting new graphics, new NPCs or improving the game mechanics. This is a brilliant idea with a lot of possibilities, but they aren't explored at all. Because of this, the game will lacks any kind of depth, complexity or challenge. Although there is one part we switch between two D and three D graphics to get past an area. I like that I want to see more of that kind of stuff but the whole game is super charming with evolving from the past. But the most it does with these ideas is making references to other iconic video games and it's super short. Even with the extra stuff, you can beat it in under 4 hours. I really wanted to see more. The evolution idea is fantastic, but it's wasted on something, is trying to be nothing more than a parody making the game average at best. Evil Land gets a five out of ten.
